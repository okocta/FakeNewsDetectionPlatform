# FakeNewsDetectionPlatform

A Flask-based web application for detecting and discussing fake news. This platform allows users to verify news using the Google Fact Check API and engage in discussions through a forum. Users can post verified claims from the API along with their thoughts, and the forum organizes these posts chronologically, providing a search functionality for easy navigation.
